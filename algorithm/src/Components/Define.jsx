        <h1>Design Algorithm</h1>
        <p>Algorithm design techniques refer to systematic approaches and
            methodologies used by computer scientists and programmers to 
            develop efficient and effective algorithms for solving 
            computational problems.</p>
            <p>
            Each technique offers a unique strategy for problem-solving, often leveraging mathematical 
            principles, logical reasoning, and computational efficiency considerations.
            </p>
            <p> Algorithm design techniques play a crucial role in empowering developers to create 
                efficient, scalable, and robust algorithms that address a wide range of computational 
                problems effectively.</p>
